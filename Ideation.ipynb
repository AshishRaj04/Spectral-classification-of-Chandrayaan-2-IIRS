        "# Imaging Infrared Spectrometer\n",
        "Chandrayaan-2's Imaging Infrared Spectrometer (IIRS) is an advanced instrument designed to map the lunar surface in the infrared spectrum. It was a part of India's second lunar exploration mission, Chandrayaan-2, which was launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on July 22, 2019. The IIRS is specifically **intended to analyze the mineral composition of the moon's surface** and to map its thermal characteristics.\n",
        "* **Mineralogical Mapping**: IIRS helps in creating detailed maps of the moon's mineral composition, which can provide insights into its formation and evolution.\n",
        "* **Water Molecule Detection**: It assists in detecting and mapping hydroxyl and water molecules on the lunar surface, which is vital for future lunar exploration and potential resource utilization."

        "     Group or categorize the data based on similar observation parameters (e.g., angle of observation, altitude, phase angle). This ensures that the comparisons and classifications are made on data that are geometrically similar, reducing the noise and errors introduced by geometric differences.\n",
